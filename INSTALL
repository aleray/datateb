This Program has been tested on OSX 10.4, using the builted-in python 2.3 version.
It needs the following libraries to work succesfully:

- PyAppscript : http://appscript.sourceforge.net/py-appscript/
- PyObjC : http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/

After installing those dependencies, just copy the droplets over your desktop,
and start using them!

For now only the Magnet bin works (more or less) properly.

The can named base is used as a template droplet. 
The folder original contains dirty mockup code (aren't we talking about waste management here?) to be recycled.
