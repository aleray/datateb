Datateb is an add-on to your Mac OSX operating system that implements,
figuratively speaking, "digital waste management". Using the familiar computer
desktop icon and user metaphor of the recycling bin, it implements for the
first time smart digital waste separation through a number of specialized
recycling bins for different types of data, providing more efficient,
customized recycling strategies that minimize superfluous consumption of
storage and transmission bits on personal computers.
